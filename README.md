# Attendy

A web application hosted on heroku that users can use to create and maintain their own elo rating system for any 1 vs 1 activity, such as ping-pong, FIFA, or heads-up poker. As a chess player, this was inspired by the chess elo system and the algorithm behind it is virtually the same albeit less complicated regarding provisional players who just enter the system.
